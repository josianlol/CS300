Throughout this course, I focused on designing and implementing a system to manage and process course information for a university's Computer Science department. The primary challenge was to efficiently read course data from a file, store it effectively, and provide functionalities to list courses in alphanumeric order and retrieve specific course details, including prerequisites. Tackling this problem required a deep understanding of various data structures, as their selection and implementation directly impacted the programâ€™s performance. By exploring vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BST), I was able to assess the unique advantages each structure offered for different operations. This experience underscored the importance of making informed decisions about which data structures to use based on the specific needs of an application.

As I worked through the project, I encountered challenges, particularly in balancing efficient search operations with the need to maintain an ordered list of courses. By carefully analyzing the time and space complexities associated with each data structure, I made strategic choices about which structure to implement in different parts of the program. For example, while vectors provided simple and efficient sequential access, hash tables excelled in fast lookups, and BSTs were ideal for maintaining sorted data. These decisions were critical in overcoming obstacles and ensuring that the final program was both effective and efficient. The experience also highlighted the importance of attention to detail when implementing recursive algorithms and managing edge cases, particularly in the more complex BST operations.

This project has significantly influenced my approach to software design and development. I now place greater emphasis on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, using clear and consistent naming conventions, modular design, and thorough documentation. This focus not only makes the code easier to understand and maintain but also ensures that it is flexible enough to accommodate future changes. The lessons learned in this project have deepened my understanding of data structures and their critical role in software development, refining my problem-solving strategies and enhancing my coding practices. These experiences will serve as a strong foundation for future projects, contributing to my growth and effectiveness as a software developer.
